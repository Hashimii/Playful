In this project, our team utilized a comprehensive skill set to develop a robust solution for monitoring and predicting the energy yield of PV systems. Leveraging SQL (SQL Server, MySQL, PostgreSQL) for efficient data management, we seamlessly integrated database interactions using SQLAlchemy to handle schema changes and ensure data consistency. We employed various Python libraries, including Pandas, NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib, and Scikit-Learn, for data preprocessing, analysis, and building predictive models. Specifically, we used the MLPRegressor module to train neural network models, GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning, and StandardScaler for data normalization. These models were trained on historical weather data, installation characteristics, and past energy yields to forecast future performance and detect potential faults. Additionally, we gathered necessary external data through web scraping tools like Selenium and Scrapy and implemented a web interface using Flask/Django/FastAPI for streamlined data access and visualization. Our integration with Microsoft Azure (DataBricks, Azure Data Lake, Azure Data Warehouse) and basic use of Microsoft Power BI further enhanced our data storage and reporting capabilities.
